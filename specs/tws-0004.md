# Token

Simple token standard, mostly inspired by [existing experimental contract](https://github.com/EmelyanenkoK/TRC20).

# Spec

To implement token contract MUST implement required methods and provide information in it's introspection

## Get Methods

### get_name
Returns the name of the token - e.g. "MyToken". Could be empty.
`slice get_name()`

### get_symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. “HIX”. Could be empty

`slice get_symbol()`

### get_decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. 8, means to divide the token amount by 100000000 to get its user representation.

`int get_decimals()`

### get_total_supply

Returns the total token supply.

`int get_total_supply()`

### balance_of

Returns the account balance of another account with address 'owner'.

`int balance_of(slice owner)`

### allowance

Returns the amount which 'spender' is still allowed to withdraw from 'owner'.

`int allowance(slice owner, slice spender)`


## Inernal Methods

### transfer

Transfers 'value' amount of tokens to address 'to_addr'. The function SHOULD throw if the message caller’s account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

```void transfer#52551(int64 queryId, slice to_addr, amount Coins, ref payload)```

Note Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers.

'payload' is optional extra data.

After completion an standard transfer message must be sent.

### transfer_from

```void transfer_from#13188(int64 queryId, from_addr addr, slice to_addr, amount Coins, ref payload)```

Transfers 'value' amount of tokens from address 'from_addr' to address 'to_addr'.

The transfer_from method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf. This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies. The function SHOULD throw unless the 'from' account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

Note Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers.

'payload' is optional extra data.

After completion a standard transfer message must be sent.


### approve

```void approve#54746(int64 query_id, spender_addr addr, value Coins, ref payload)```

Allows 'spender' to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the 'value' amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with 'value'.

NOTE: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/), contract REQUIRES set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender.

'payload' is optional extra data.

After completion a standard approve message must be sent.

### increase/decrease allowance

```void update_allowance#23782(int64 query_id, spender_addr addr, delta_value Coins, ref payload)```


Atomically increase/decrease the allowance by 'delta_value', granted to 'spender' by the caller. This is an alternative to 'approve' method.  

'payload' is optional extra data.

After completion a standard allowance change message must be sent.

### Rollback

If the transfer recipient sends a 0xffffffff response (the operation is not supported) or if a bounced message arrives (an error occurred on the recipient side): 

* If message was a transfer: transfer must be returned (equivalent of transfer from receiver to sender).

* If message was a transfer_from: sent tokens must be approved in favor sender (equivalent receiver approves tokens in favor sender).

NOTE: the response must contain the body of the original message.

This prevents the loss of tokens sent to a contract that does not support them.

When happen a standard rollback message must be sent.

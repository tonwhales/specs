# Basic introspection spec (rev 2)

This is highly valuable specification that required for almost all contracts in order to be properly indexed by explorers, wallets and marketplaces. This specification mostly aims to help avoiding clashes between different interfaces and not provide something very strict definition language.

## Spec

In order to support introspection contract should implement supports_interface GET method:

```(int...) supported_interfaces()```

Which returns list of supported interface codes.

### Interface

Interface is defined by some uint16 associated with all function selectors of interface called interfaceID. Interface is a CRC-16 of formal definition of all methods.

### Formal description

Formal definition could contain any number of extra text, identifiers when needed.

There are three kind of methods: external method (message), internal and get-methods (pure).

```func
get $definition$
int $definition$
ext $definition$
```

For example, wallet interface will look like with CRC-16 value of `52773`:
```
get int seqno()
get int get_public_key()
ext void transfer(int512 signature, int subwallet_id, int valid_until, int seqno, cell messages)
```

Subscription wallet could look like with CRC-16 value of `45058`:
```
int void plugin_request_funds(int coins, cell extras)
int void plugin_remove()
ext void deploy_and_install_plugin(int512 signature, int wc, int balance, cell stateInit, cell body)
ext void install_plugin(int512 signature, slice address, int balance, int64 query_id)
ext void plugin_remove(int512 signature, slice address, int balance, int64 query_id)
```

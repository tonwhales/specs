# Standard Messages

TON is very low level blockchain and often you need something user friendly to show to users about their transactions. For example, comment or token transfer notification. This spec if formal description of what already used in TON.

# Spec

With any transfer TONCOIN allows to specify arbitrary payloads, but first 4 bytes are recommended to be used as operation identifier. We will reference this first 4 bytes as `op`, short of "operation". Contracts are free to use any `op` values as they want except `0x00000000`. When `op` is equal to `0x00000000` this means that this is a simple transfer with a comment.

## Simple tansfer with comment

If the byte right after `op` is NOT equal to `0xff` than this is a simple text comment that should be user readable. If it is equal to `0xff` than this is a "binary" comment that shouldn't be shown to end user.

Comment is written as series of referenced cells. If comment couldn't fit into a single cell it should add a new referenced cell and write next batch of data there.
